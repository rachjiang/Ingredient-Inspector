# Ingredient Inspector

Ingredient Inspector is the foodie's version of Shazam! 

This project was inspired by the desire to know what certain food ingredients are called when seeing them in passing.

Similar to how Shazam detects songs that we hear in passing, Ingredient Inspector accepts food-related image URLs and lists out the name of the dish, and/or ingredients with an accuracy rate. 

This is made possible through a visual-recognition AI model provided by Clarifai's machine learning API.

Currently, the food-recognition model used is mostly accurate with well-known dishes and requires some training to expand its palate.
